# UK-Crime-Report---R
 Abstract Background: Recently R as a data analysis tool has become widely popular among data scientists.  However, outputs in R have not always been easy to interpret for the laymen.  Aim: We have aimed to harness the power of R to provide a visual and written analysis of an important dataset regarding crimes in the UK.  Methodology: This report has been produced by using R functions and packages which were appropriate for the aggregation and analysis of the key variables present in our dataset. Comparisons of finding were also made with regards to past reports on crime in the UK. Conclusions: Like in many other countries, the level of crimes in the UK is seasonal and is concentrated around major cities. It was also found that the data provided by the police forces lack completeness.
